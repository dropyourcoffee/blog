First milestone done for project Zikto Lab.<br>
Server-side has been demonstrated on a mac instead of Raspberry Pi.

For the milestone, I focused on illustrating the project concept.<br>
The dashboard UI is very minimal for now.


For now, I have completed
 - Skeleton code for middleware for generic BLE peripheral and Zikto-walk (Needs to be elaborated)
 - Asynchronously handling BLE gatt services characteristics using async functions and promise.
 - Backend REST APIs
 - Ajax on frontend


TODOs by the next milestone
 - Code Elaboration
 - Graphical representation on sampled data
 - Downloading sampled data in csv.
